"""


ANALYSIS_POLICY = """
Lead with a bounded principal finding: what functions well, what is constrained,
and how widespread the constraint is. Support it with a few anchor statistics,
then explain the actual components, geographic patterns and important exceptions.
Retain all material findings, including favourable components that qualify the
interpretation. Explain subsection scores through their own components; distinguish
formal components from explanatory observations. Do not infer specific problems
from a dimension name or score alone, or describe overall MFI as a simple average
of dimension scores. Use the authoritative stored scores without recalculation.
Select statistics for a clear purpose: an average for the overall level, a
distribution for unevenness and extremes for meaningful exceptions. Avoid redundant
overlapping threshold inventories. Use supplied counts, rankings and ties; a median
can have more than half the observations at or below it. Keep within-market and
between-market ranks distinct. Relative rank is not an absolute severity category;
do not invent severity thresholds or claim statistical significance without a basis.
Keep scores, proportions, counts and binary conditions distinct. Express a value
out of 10 as a score, not a rate or percentage. Express a proportion as a percentage
only of its stated population; describe binary conditions as recorded conditions.
Preserve the population, denominator, coverage and aggregation basis given by
permitted_subject_phrase or subject and the accompanying evidence fields. Natural,
semantically equivalent wording is allowed; verbatim repetition is not required.
An unweighted mean of within-market trader proportions is not a pooled percentage
of traders, respondents or responses, nor a share of assessed markets. Make that
averaging basis clear when introducing the figures and preserve it thereafter.
For Food Quality, distinguish the normalised score out of 10 from the raw number
of satisfied conditions and the number of applicable conditions. Never compare
the normalised score with the raw applicable maximum or treat the applicable count
as a performance score. Mention a satisfied/applicable count only when both raw
values are supplied; do not reconstruct them from a rounded score. These counts
are validation quantities, not two ordinary performance subsections.
Do not rank descriptive distributions as adverse rates. Interpret infrastructure
condition flags according to their coding; do not assume they are mutually
exclusive shares of buildings or require overlapping categories to sum to 100%.
Distinguish zero, missing, not assessed, insufficient coverage and not applicable.
A zero score need not mean total absence of goods or activity. An item not sold
by surveyed outlets is not necessarily absent throughout the area.
Preserve market identity and administrative levels. Group meaningful geographic
patterns and identify exceptions; a regional average does not describe every
constituent market. Explain a local difference through matching local evidence;
when only scores are available, describe the difference without inventing drivers.
Do not infer remoteness, urbanisation or transport links from a place name.
Distinguish the components contributing to a score from causes of the underlying
condition. Synthesis across supported findings is useful, but co-occurrence does
not establish causation. Attribute respondent explanations as reported explanations.
Do not invent mechanisms or resulting outcomes, including haggling from absent
price labels. Adding 'likely', 'reflects' or 'suggests' does not supply evidence.
External context is optional. Use it only when it clarifies a relevant finding;
cite supplied sources using [S1] style references and check support for the actual
claim, geography and assessment timing. Distinguish contextual facts, corroboration
and possible explanations; do not infer local causality from a regional event.
If sources and assessment results disagree, state the unresolved discrepancy
without inventing timing, sampling or methodological explanations. Do not redefine
an indicator's scope to reconcile it with context. If context is unavailable,
rely on the assessment and follow the limitation placement rules.
Separate assessment dates, question recall or prediction periods and source dates.
Use 'improved', 'recovered', 'remained' and other change or persistence language only
with comparable evidence. Check methods, dimensions, units, geography and coverage
before comparing rounds. Draft versions are not separate assessment periods.
When evidence is inconsistent with its unit, scale or denominator, omit the
disputed statistic from narrative and use unaffected evidence. Identify the
specific issue and interpretive consequence in notes, without internal identifiers;
apply the limitation placement rules if the section needs a qualification. Do not
silently repair source data, recalculate scores or invent a denominator. A negative
adverse percentage, for example, must not be presented as a valid finding.
"""


STYLE_POLICY = """
Write clear, restrained British/UN English, using consistent dimension, product
and geographic names. Develop one analytical point per paragraph with a logical
connection to the next. Use fuller narrative to explain supported relationships
and exceptions, not to pad sparse evidence or repeat statistics and qualifications.
Write concretely about markets, traders, goods, facilities and recorded practices.
Explain necessary technical terms and define acronyms on first use. Replace
internal field phrasing with the actual finding while preserving its statistical
meaning. Avoid emotive intensifiers, broad labels of economic underdevelopment,
repetitive scene-setting and stacked qualifications. State supported findings
directly. Use 'reported' for responses, 'observed' only when the collection method
supports it, and 'recorded' when that distinction is unavailable. Use past tense
for assessment observations, present tense for definitions and dated wording for
external context.
In prose, normally use one decimal for scores and whole percentages. Retain extra
precision where needed for a meaningful difference or a small non-zero value;
do not round it misleadingly to zero. Never round before ranking or comparison.
Word ranges are guides, not quotas. Preserve explanatory detail where evidence
warrants it; do not enforce identical paragraph lengths or sentence templates.
"""


RECOMMENDATION_POLICY = """
Recommendations concern market functionality, mitigation and market strengthening.
Link each action to a measured constraint, preserving its assessment period,
geography and affected goods or services. A low score or rank alone does not
identify a specific remedy or establish urgency. Judge priorities by severity,
spread, operational importance and evidence quality; do not invent thresholds.
A high overall score does not cancel a serious component-level concern.
Use the measured component to choose the response, not a standard intervention
package for each dimension. Assortment is the range of goods offered; availability
concerns scarcity and stock-outs. Price unpredictability does not establish
affordability. Distinguish stock coverage/restocking from supplier dependence or
concentration. Address specific service practices; missing electronic payments or
remote purchasing does not automatically justify digitalisation. Food Quality
conditions do not measure the share of contaminated food or establish that a
licence guarantees safety.
Allow a concrete, proportionate action when the constraint and suitable response
are supported, such as support for a documented retail practice or improvement of
a missing market facility. Do not automatically request verification of an
already established finding. Use a conditional option when suitability depends
on unresolved implementation feasibility, and name that condition. Use targeted
investigation when evidence cannot identify an appropriate remedy; a score alone
does not justify costly works or a technically specific solution. The observed
need does not prove an intervention's effectiveness. State intended operational
purposes without promising benefits or asserting demonstrated causal effects.
Monitoring must specify what, where and the concern or decision it informs.
Consultation or assessment must identify an unresolved question. Neither is a
default substitute for an appropriate corrective action. If no material constraint
warrants action, omit a corrective recommendation; mention routine monitoring
only when it serves a specific purpose.
Prefer one or two sentences per recommendation linking constraint, action and
purpose, without mechanically repeating a sentence template. Use concrete,
restrained verbs; use direct action language for supported measures and 'consider'
only for a genuine option or condition. Restate numbers only when they help the
decision. Name relevant actor types and distinguish immediate from longer-term
measures where supported and useful. Do not invent commitments, budgets,
procurement arrangements, deadlines or monitoring frequencies.
Combine overlapping actions and sequence prerequisites where justified. Keep
dimension and market recommendations consistent, but never assign an aggregate
finding to an individual market without local evidence. The same action may be
appropriate in several markets when each has its own justification; do not invent
different interventions merely to vary the wording.
"""


LIMITATION_POLICY = """
The application already prints the report-wide methodology note on unweighted
assessed-market descriptions and lack of population representativeness. Do not
repeat that note in section prose or notes. In responses containing notes, retain
other supplied report-wide limitations and the supplied context limitation there,
using their exact supplied text once each so the application can deduplicate
them across responses. Preserve valid original notes during correction.
Include a limitation in section prose only when it materially affects that
section's interpretation or recommendation, alongside the affected finding.
Explain its specific consequence briefly; do not append a standard disclaimer
paragraph or automatically repeat item-denominator caveats in every section.
Use analytical safeguards to bound claims, not as stock sentences about what
every dimension fails to establish. Do not publish internal drafting restrictions,
metric identifiers or instructions to the model. Review draft notes using these
same placement and relevance rules.
"""


DIMENSION_GUIDANCE = """
Aim for 450-650 words per dimension, with fuller explanatory paragraphs. Open with
the principal finding and a few anchor statistics, then develop the component
explanation, geographic patterns and important local or product exceptions, and
the supported interpretation. Combine or reorder these where the evidence reads
more naturally. Cover the material distribution, supported subsections/components,
fixed drivers and relevant items without mechanically listing every statistic.
Where recommendations are warranted, end with a short concluding paragraph
synthesising the principal measured constraints, corresponding actions and
geographic or product focus. Preserve differences and exceptions across markets
or groups. Detailed individual-market action lists belong in market profiles.
"""


MARKET_GUIDANCE = """
Keep market profiles concise (about 150-220 words) and preserve requested order.
Open with the market's distinctive local situation, including relevant strengths
and constraints. Explain its priority constraints using its own available component
findings, goods and facilities; do not fill missing local detail with aggregate
drivers or assumed causes. Select up to three distinct, locally justified action
priorities; this is a ceiling, not a quota. Briefly give the local reason for each
measure, combine overlapping actions, and do not reproduce all nine dimensions
or prescribe an intervention merely because a dimension ranks lowest locally.
