"""Phase R3 tests for narrative safety rules.

R3 stops the report reaching operational conclusions the assessment cannot support. The
rules are deliberately broad — a hedged conclusion is still a conclusion — which makes
false positives the main hazard: the entire deterministic path must keep validating
cleanly, or several test files go red at once.

The first test in this file is therefore the most important one. It runs every string the
system produces without an LLM through every new rule and asserts none of them fires.
