# WFP Unified App -- Overview

## Mission

The Unified App is the primary deliverable of two converging AI initiatives at the World Food Programme (WFP):

1. **VAM LLM** -- an LLM-powered solution that assists VAM (Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping) officers in Country Offices and Global HQ with data analysis and the drafting of analytical reports on market conditions and food security.

2. **MarketAIssist** -- an LLM-powered solution that supports the cleaning and validation of large datasets on food security, prices, and market functionality, so the data can be processed and publicly shared on WFP's DataBridges platform.

Together the two projects address opposite ends of the same data pipeline: MarketAIssist ensures that incoming data is correct and publication-ready, while VAM LLM turns validated data into actionable intelligence reports.

## What the App Does

The application exposes **four services** through a Streamlit frontend (with a parallel FastAPI backend for programmatic access):

### MarketAIssist Services (Data Validation)

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **MFI Dataset Validator** | Validates RAW Market Functionality Index CSV files against the WFP schema. Runs five progressive validation layers -- file format, structural integrity, schema conformance, business rules (UUIDs, dates, coordinates, survey completeness), and an LLM-generated diagnostic report. Supports fuzzy column-name matching to catch typos. |
| **Price Data Validator** | Validates price-data XLSX workbooks against WFP templates. Checks file integrity, column structure and ordering, and uses an LLM to classify column types and verify content (commodity codes, market names, date formats). |

### VAM LLM Services (Report Generation)

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **MFI Report Generator** | Produces a full Market Functionality Index report for a given country. Loads MFI survey data (from CSV upload or the DataBridges API), retrieves contextual news from Seerist and ReliefWeb, generates radar-chart visualisations, drafts a per-dimension analysis across the nine MFI dimensions, synthesises an executive summary, runs Red-Team QA, and exports the result as a branded DOCX document. |
| **Market Monitor Drafter** | Produces a Market Monitor (Price Bulletin) report. Country Offices configure a required primary basket and an optional independently scoped secondary basket; immutable selections drive joint reportability, complete-component calculations, separate charts, basket-aware narratives, Red-Team QA, and DOCX export. Optional exchange-rate, fuel, livestock, and labour modules remain evidence-gated. |

                       |  - Retrievers   |
                       |  - DataBridges  |
                       |  - Async Runs   |
                       |  - DOCX Export  |
                       +-----------------+
```

Each service is a self-contained FastAPI router whose core logic lives in a **LangGraph state-machine** (`graph.py`). The shared layer provides:

- **LLM singleton** -- Google Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro by default), zero temperature, with retry and timeout policies.
- **Retrievers** -- Seerist and ReliefWeb clients that fetch contextual news for 60+ WFP-relevant countries.
- **DataBridges client** -- OAuth2-authenticated access to WFP's DataBridges API for MFI survey data and price time-series.
- **Async run manager** -- tracks long-running jobs with progress, warnings, and artifacts; pluggable backend (in-memory for dev, Firestore + GCS for production).
- **DOCX exporter** -- converts an abstract `ReportBlock` model (headings, paragraphs, tables, figures, definition boxes, references) into a branded Word document with embedded visualisations.

## MFI Dimensions

The Market Functionality Index is scored across nine dimensions, each on a 0-10 scale:

| Dimension | What it measures |
|---|---|
| Assortment | Variety of goods available |
| Availability | Stock presence and sufficiency |
| Price | Price levels and affordability |
| Resilience | Market capacity to absorb shocks |
| Competition | Number and diversity of traders |
| Infrastructure | Physical market infrastructure |
| Service | Quality of market services |
| Food Quality | Safety and quality of food products |
| Access & Protection | Physical access and safety for consumers |

Risk classification: **Very High** (< 4.0), **High** (4.0 -- 5.5), **Medium** (5.5 -- 7.0), **Low** (>= 7.0).

## External Integrations

| System | Role |
|---|---|
| **WFP DataBridges** | Primary source for MFI survey data and commodity price time-series. OAuth2 client-credentials flow. |
| **Seerist** | Intelligence/news aggregation. Provides contextual documents on markets, prices, inflation, currency, and trade for a given country and time window. |
| **ReliefWeb** | UN humanitarian reporting. Supplements Seerist with reports on food security and market conditions. |
| **Trading Economics** | Exchange-rate data for 15+ currencies used in the Market Monitor. |
| **Google Vertex AI** | LLM backend (Gemini 2.5 Pro). Powers fuzzy matching, schema validation, narrative generation, event extraction, trend analysis, and Red-Team QA. |
| **Google Cloud Storage** | Stores run artifacts and cached reference data in production. |

## Processing Pipelines

### Validation (MarketAIssist)

```
Upload file  -->  Layer 0: File format & encoding
             -->  Layer 1: Structural parsing (delimiters, broken rows)
             -->  Layer 2: Schema conformance (required columns, fuzzy match)
             -->  Layer 3: Business rules (dates, UUIDs, coordinates, completeness)
             -->  Layer 5: LLM-generated diagnostic report
             -->  Structured JSON result with errors, warnings, suggestions
```

### Report Generation (VAM LLM)

```
User input  -->  Data loading (CSV / DataBridges API / mock)
            -->  External retrieval (Seerist + ReliefWeb, in parallel)
            -->  Context extraction and summarisation (LLM)
            -->  Visualisation generation (Matplotlib --> Base64 PNG)
            -->  Section drafting (LLM, per dimension or per module)
            -->  Executive summary / highlights (LLM)
            -->  Red-Team QA with correction loop (LLM)
            -->  DOCX export with embedded charts and WFP branding
```

---

## Deployment

The application is containerised with Docker. The `start.sh` script launches **Streamlit only** on port 8080 (the current `docker-streamlit-only` branch configuration). In this mode the Streamlit frontend calls service logic directly through the in-process dispatcher rather than over HTTP to a separate FastAPI process.

For production, the app supports:

- **Firestore + GCS** backend for persistent run tracking and artifact storage (toggled via `RUNS_BACKEND=firestore_gcs`).
- **Google Vertex AI** authentication via service account or application-default credentials.
- **CORS** configuration for cross-origin API access when the FastAPI backend is exposed separately.
- **Reversible second-basket rollout** via `MARKET_MONITOR_SECOND_BASKET_ENABLED`. It defaults to enabled; setting it to `false` blocks new secondary configuration and selection while preserving history and completed report exports.
